/**
 * Escapement — browser demo.
 *
 * The four shaders below are copied unedited from `source/Shaders.cpp`,
 * including the `#ifdef ESCAPEMENT_EFFECT` branches — the two bundles really are
 * one set of shaders compiled twice, and the picker in the transport bar
 * compiles them both ways here for the same reason. `withDefines()` inserts the
 * define after the `#version` line exactly as `Escapement.cpp` does, and
 * `demo/tools/check_shaders.py` compares the literals against the C++ character
 * for character.
 *
 * `Taps.cpp`, `Loop.cpp` and `Controls.cpp` are ported below. That port is the
 * interesting part of this page, because it is the plugin's whole design:
 *
 * **The fractals are the loop's attractor, not a formula.** A tap is one path
 * from the screen back into the camera; a set of taps is an iterated function
 * system; the fractal is what the loop settles into. `taps()` returns three
 * affine maps and the Sierpinski gasket arrives on its own. There is no
 * gasket-drawing code here, exactly as there is none in the plugin.
 *
 * ## This page is stateful, and no other demo in the fleet is
 *
 * Every other page in this kit renders a frame that is a pure function of
 * (parameters, time), so Step is exact and any frame can be drawn on its own. A
 * feedback rig cannot work that way — the picture is the whole history of the
 * loop, and the frame store is the instrument's memory.
 *
 * Two consequences, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - **The loop only advances on elapsed time.** A redraw caused by moving a
 *     slider while paused re-runs the *display* pass and no fields at all, so
 *     tweaking Palette or Opacity is instant and tweaking Gain does nothing
 *     until you press play. That is what the plugin does too: fields come from
 *     the host's clock delta, not from the frame having been drawn.
 *   - **Restart clears the store**, because restarting a rig means switching it
 *     on again. Scrubbing backwards does the same.

// rectangular blocks about eight pixels across, which is exactly the width at

Restart switches the rig off and on again, because a feedback loop cannot be rewound.',
    'The frame store is RGBA16F here and in the plugin, but the browser reaches it through EXT_color_buffer_float rather than desktop GL. A machine without that extension gets an error rather than a quietly quantised picture — 8 bits mid-loop would clip the signal at both ends every field, which is a hard knee in the wrong place.',

The Extended precision setting gets its extra bits from Dekker\'s split, which is only a no-op if the compiler is forbidden to reassociate it — the plugin forbids it with GLSL\'s `precise` keyword, and GLSL ES 3.00 does not have that keyword at all, so the port strips it.
